## Introduction

- The three attributes of domain, type, sub_type determine a device (may be product, payload, battery).
- The domain represents a domain, as a namespace, temporarily divided into four types: aircraft-0, payload-1, and RC-2, airport-3.
- The name is the common name for cloud platform and SDK.
